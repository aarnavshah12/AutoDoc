# Knock Knock Joke Generator

This is a simple Python script to simulate a "knock knock" joke interaction with the user. The script randomly selects a punchline from a predefined set of jokes and interacts with the user to deliver the joke.

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/knock-knock-joke-generator.git
    cd knock-knock-joke-generator
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python knock_knock.py
    ```

## Code

```python
import random

def knock_knock():
    """
    Function to simulate a "knock knock" joke interaction with the user.
    """
    
    # Dictionary containing the sequence of the joke
    jokes = {
        "Who's there?": "Interrupting cow.",
        "Interrupting cow who?": "Moo moo, I'm just here to tell a joke!",
    }

    # Randomly select a punchline from the jokes dictionary values
    punchline = random.choice(list(jokes.values()))

    # Iterate over the keys in the jokes dictionary
    for line in jokes.keys():
        print(line)  # Print the joke line
        response = input("> ")  # Get user response

        # Check if the user's response matches the joke line
        if response.lower() == line.lower():
            # Print the punchline and exit the loop
            print(punchline)
            break

# Call the function to start the knock knock joke
knock_knock()
```
